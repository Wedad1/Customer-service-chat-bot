# Customer-service-chat-bot
To carry out this task, I first started by entering and registering on the IBM Watson Assistant website, then creating Assistant with the title Customer Service Bot, in which I created a skill titled Customer Service, then I started building intents for the skill and the intents are what we expect the user to say and I created three intents I expected from the user. First the greeting always the user starts greeting like hi or hello, the second is when he enters the arm control interface and the base I expected him to ask about the fighting robot, third, mostly when the customer finished saying thank you, so this must be expected,then I created the entities, which are the values that we detected from the intents. In the intents, I expected him to be asked about the fighting robot, and I detected from the intents that the values that the user might ask about could be the maximum degree of the motor, the number of motors, or the type of motor. then I created the dialogues, which is the response from the chatbot to the user, I created five dialogues to respond to each of the intents and entities,then I integrated the chatbot into the website by taking the code that the IBM Watson Assistant website shows after creating the web chat in the way I mentioned above and placing it in the script file of my website.
